PeopleTracker
=============

Object tracking is the method used to estimate the time and location of one or more moving objects captured by a digital camera. The idea is to keep track of an object from on several consecutive frames, this may become difficult if the object is moving fast in relation to the frame rate of the camera. The initial purpose of the project was to measure the customers interests towards an advertising by using the OpenCV library. But during the development we found other possibles applications for this technique.
